4002,"Deep Spiking Neural Network with Ternary Spikes",Undecided,N/A,,,,,,,,,,3,"Bio-Inspired and Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems","In SNNs, the neurons communicate with each other with binary spikes. However, the coding efficiency for the rate coding scheme is low, and a long time window is usually required for the training and inferencing of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly ternary spikes scheme to achieve higher efficiency of information transfer, and an SCNN with ternary spikes is trained using backpropagation. The proposed SCNN achieves competitive performance on MNIST dataset and Fashion-MNIST dataset with a short window, thus the latency and the computations of the SCNN can be greatly reduced.","Spiking Neural Network, Ternary Spikes, Backpropagation",,,,,Academia,Congyi,Sun,,,,"Nanjing University",Nanjing,,210023,China,,,suncy@smail.nju.edu.cn,Congyi,Sun,"Nanjing University",suncy@smail.nju.edu.cn,China,Qinyu,Chen,"University of Zurich",qinyu@ini.uzh.ch,Switzerland,Yuxiang,Fu,"Nanjing University",yuxiangfu@nju.edu.cn,China,Li,Li,"Nanjing University",lili@nju.edu.cn,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sun, Chen, Fu, Li","C.

4008,"Various Distance Metrics Evaluationon Neural Spike Classification",Undecided,N/A,,,,,,,,,,12,"Biosignal Recording, Processing, and Machine Learning","State-of-the-art neuroscience applications require the classification of action potential activities (or spikes) recorded by multi-channel electrodes, named spike sorting. A typical spike sorting algorithm involves three parts: detection, feature extraction, and training/classification. Training/classification stages are mainly based on distance-based algorithms like k-means. For the classification, in particular, the accuracy depends highly on the distance metric performance. In this paper, we analyze several distance metrics to classify various datasets with different noise levels using the F1 score. This includes Manhattan, Euclidean, and, Mahalanobis distance metrics. As a result, the Mahalanobis distance metric outperforms other metrics in noisy conditions by an average of 10% in the presence of the noise.","Biomedical signal processing, spike sorting, distance measurement, Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance,classification",,,,,Academia,Shengpeng,Guo,,,,"Technical University Dresden",Dresden,,01069,Germany,,,shengpeng.guo@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,Shengpeng,Guo,"Technical University Dresden",shengpeng.guo@mailbox.tu-dresden.de,Germany,Liyuan,Guo,"Technical University Dresden",liyuan.guo@tu-dresden.de,Germany,"Seyed Mohammad Ali",Zeinolabedin,"Technical University Dresden",ali.zeinolabedin@tu-dresden.de,Germany,Christian,Mayr,"Technical University Dresden",christian.mayr@tu-dresden.de,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guo, Guo, Zeinolabedin, Mayr","S.

It is hence useful to better understand and model biological principles shaping these networks besides synaptic changes, such as axon growth. As the few existing implementations focus on technical abstractions of the latter aspect, in this work, we aim for a bio-inspired circuit implementing axon growth well comparable to biological processes.

In this context, memristor-based solutions for inhibitory synapses are hardly explored so far, with the few existing ones being only abstractly bio-inspired. Our aim is to synthesize a biologically more meaningful, memristive inhibitory synapse model based on modeling ion channels in the fashion of conductance-based neuron models. For this purpose, we use a memristive voltage source which can be tuned to act either excitatory or inhibitory and where a retention characteristic models the synapse\'s ability to forget. We utilize the memristive voltage source in combination with an equivalent circuit of the Morris-Lecar model to replicate the visual contrast perception in neuronal networks via lateral inhibition. Simulation results verify the circuit approach as the perceived contrast increases when the memristance decreases.","Memristors, Neuromorphic Engineering, Inhibitory Synapse, Morris-Lecar Model",,,,,Academia,Sebastian,Jenderny,"Universitätsstraße 150",,"Chair of Digital Communication Systems","Ruhr-University Bochum",Bochum,NRW,44801,Germany,,,Sebastian.Jenderny@rub.de,Sebastian,Jenderny,"Ruhr-University Bochum",Sebastian.Jenderny@rub.de,Germany,Karlheinz,Ochs,"Ruhr-University Bochum",Karlheinz.Ochs@rub.de,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jenderny, Ochs","S.

When transitioning from a measurement laboratory prototype to a biomedical circuit for chronic implantation in humans, safety features and regulations are of utmost importance. One example for a safety-related feature is built-in electrode impedance estimation. Monitoring the electrode condition is crucial for early detection of electrode aging and decay, and allows to adapt stimulation parameters to the changes in the electrodetissue interface. Prior implementations used time domain analysis or transfer function estimations, which are both bound to a predefined model and vulnerable against noise and disturbers.

The method is based on the inductance change of an anchoring loop mounted on a miniaturized system implanted in a section of the pulmonary artery. The inductive sensor comprises an inductive readout circuit and a conductive anchoring loop, which changes its inductance according to the deformation of the artery and can be correlated to the diameter and CSA of the artery section. Direct and periodic measurement of the CSA can improve the accuracy of CO monitoring in heart failure patients. An oscillator-based inductive readout IC was realized in a 180-nm CMOS process and the anchoring loop was implemented by a nitinol wire. The readout IC achieves 0.42 nH inductance resolution in a range from 181 nH to 681 nH and draws 39.7 μA to 51.2 μA current from a 1.2 V supply. The correlation between the artery diameter and loop inductance is demonstrated and the sensor achieves 0.24 mm resolution in a diameter range from 20 mm to 30 mm, a factor of four higher than the lateral resolution of echocardiography.","heart failure (HF), medical implantable device, pulmonary artery, inductive readout circuit, cross-sectional area (CSA) measurement, cardiac output",,,,,Academia,Mustafa,Besirli,"EPFL SCI STI MM ELB 141 (Bâtiment ELB)","Station 11","Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",Lausanne,Vaud,CH-1015,Switzerland,+41216935660,,mustafa.besirli@epfl.ch,Mustafa,Besirli,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",mustafa.besirli@epfl.ch,Switzerland,Kerim,Ture,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",ture.kerim@gmail.com,Switzerland,Maurice,Beghetti,"Geneva University Hospitals (HUG)",Maurice.Beghetti@hcuge.ch,Switzerland,Catherine,Dehollain,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",catherine.dehollain@epfl.ch,Switzerland,Marco,Mattavelli,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",marco.mattavelli@epfl.ch,Switzerland,Diego,Barrettino,"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)",diego.barrettino@epfl.ch,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Besirli, Ture, Beghetti, Dehollain, Mattavelli, Barrettino","M.

However, the basis for this absence is not well understood. In this study, we present a noninvasive SSEP Granger causality interaction (GCI) measure to quantify the thalamocortical (TC) dissociation after CA. We selected Daubechies 6 (db6) wavelet as the optimized wavelet for SSEPs analysis based on mean square errors of baseline SSEP reconstructions. Then we extracted the SSEP N10 and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) components with the db6 wavelet. Lastly, the GCIs between N10 and HFOs were calculated as biometrics for TC dissociation after CA. Our results show that the noninvasive SSEP GCI measure can characterize the crucial first 5 to 15 minutes after CA and show separation between sham and experimental groups. Furthermore, we discover that the GCI measure can reveal TC dissociation in the sham trials, which we hypothesized to have no neurological injury. Future work can leverage the method developed here to evaluate the effects of potential interventions on TC dissociation after CA.","somatosensory evoked potential, wavelet transform, cardiac arrest, Granger causality",,,,,Academia,Ze,Ou,"733 N Broadway","Room 701","Department of Biomedical Engineering","Johns Hopkins University",Baltimore,MD,21205,"United States",(925)885-9066,,zou1@jhu.edu,Ze,Ou,"Johns Hopkins University",zou1@jhu.edu,"United States",Yu,Guo,"Johns Hopkins University",yguo64@jhmi.edu,"United States",Ariel,Slepyan,"Johns Hopkins University",aslepya1@jhu.edu,"United States",Payam,Gharibani,"Johns Hopkins University",pgharibani@gmail.com,"United States",Romergryko,Geocadin,"Johns Hopkins University",rgeocad1@jhmi.edu,"United States",Nitish,Thakor,"Johns Hopkins University",thakorjhu@gmail.com,"United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ou, Guo, Slepyan, Gharibani, Geocadin, Thakor","Z.

A 16-channel stimulator was implemented in 65 nm CMOS to validate the principle, requiring only 0.0141 mm² area/channel. Despite being implemented in a standard CMOS technology, 10.4 V compliance has been achieved for compatibility with high-impedant microelectrode arrays typical for high-resolution neurostimulators.

However, because CS adopts a linear transformation, a security risk is inevitable. Therefore, in this study, we propose a watermark cryptosystem for wireless EEG measurement devices using CS. The proposed method utilizes a watermark as an electronic signature and is resistant to denial of service (DoS) attacks, which is one of the major security risks in CS. Further, we elucidate the relationship between the accuracy of DoS attack detection and the time required for the detection. Verification using MATLAB reveals that when the signal-to-noise ratio, defined by the power of the signal vs. watermarks, is -20 dB, the signal can be reconstructed by a decoder. However, the signal cannot be reconstructed by attackers.

The image of a single tooth obtained from the periapical radiograph is processed through contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization and bilateral filtering to enhance the local contrast and to blur the less relevant areas of the image. Then, the deep learning model combining both residual network and attention mechanism is used for prediction.

4092,"Event-Driven ECG Classification Using Functional Approximation and Chebyshev Polynomials",Undecided,N/A,,,,,,,,,,12,"Biosignal Recording, Processing, and Machine Learning","Level-crossing ADCs reduce the size of data streams in wearable devices. However, in the context of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, such an event-driven data source results in a variable length two-dimensional (time-amplitude tuples) data vector for each ECG beat. It is difficult to apply many standard signal processing techniques to this data making classifiers more complex. In this paper we resolve these difficulties by mapping the variable length 2D vectors to a fixed length feature vector comprising the first 80 coefficients of a Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the ECG beat. We show that, by using these 80 coefficients, the average percentage root-mean-square error is only ≈3.08%. Using this feature set we constructed a simple three-layered ANN binary (Normal / Abnormal) ECG classifier and we demonstrate 98.15% average accuracy and 96.07% average sensitivity. We also constructed a 4-class ANN, using the same ANN structure and we achieved 98.80% average accuracy and 91.5% average sensitivity. Both these networks have only 20k parameters and outperform the state-of-the-art classifiers, enabling low-power edge computing.","level-crossing ADC, event-driven, electrocardiograms, functional approximation, chebyshev polynomials, artificial neural networks, arrhythmia",,,,,Academia,Maryam,Saeed,Belfield,,"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering","University College Dublin",Dublin,,"Dublin 4",Ireland,,,maryam.saeed@ucdconnect.ie,Maryam,Saeed,"University College Dublin",maryam.saeed@ucdconnect.ie,Ireland,Olev,Martens,"Tallinn University of Technology",olev.martens@taltech.ee,Estonia,Benoit,Larras,"Univ.

However, the traditional stethoscope may be rough and can not fully obtain useful information in the signal due to the limitation of the non-quantification and subjective diagnosis of the common stethoscope and the lack of experience of novice doctors.Thus, these create the need for an objective and active lung sound signal analysis and recognition system for clinical diagnosis. The mel - spectrogram extracted from raw audio signal is used as an input characteristic of convolutional neural network(CNN) and the long and short-term memory network(LSTM). It is concluded that CNN is used to capture spatial information of the spectrum of lung sounds, followed by LSTM to capture temporal features.

It is shown that the natural low-pass characteristic of the neuron’s membrane limits the energy trans- fer efficiency from the stimulator to the cell. Thus, to improve the transfer efficiency, it is proposed to pre-filter the high-frequency components of the stimulus. The method is validated for a Hodgkin-Huxely (HH) axon cable model using NEURON v8.0 software. To this end, the required activation energy is simulated for rectangular pulses with durations between 10 μs and 5 ms, which are low-pass filtered with cut-off frequencies of 0.5-50 kHz. Simulations show 51.5% reduction in the required activation energy for the shortest pulse width (i.e. 10 μs) after filtering at 5 kHz. It is also shown that the minimum required activation energy can be decreased by 11.04% when an appropriate pre- filter is applied. Finally, we draw a perspective for future use of this method to improve the selectivity of electrical stimulation.","neuron modeling, electrical stimulation, neuromodulation, energy transfer efficiency, frequency spectrum",,,,,Academia,Francesc,Varkevisser,"Mekelweg 4",,"Section Bioelectronics, dept.

In this study, we proposed a method to achieve a short reconstruction time by utilizing selected EEG signals. This method helped realize a small-sized basis matrix that is effective for block sparse Bayesian learning algorithms with a high reconstruction accuracy. When EEG signals were sorted using the mean frequency and only the most frequently occurring EEG signals were used in the basis matrix, an EEG signal with a length of 3 s could be recovered in only 2.3 s, while achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.16 at CR = 12.","EEG, compressed sensing, BSBL, basis matrix",,,,,Academia,Daisuke,Kanemoto,,,,"osaka university",suita,osaka,5650871,Japan,,,dkanemoto@eei.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,Daisuke,Kanemoto,"osaka university",dkanemoto@eei.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,Japan,Tetsuya,Hirose,"osaka university",dkanemoto@eei.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,Japan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kanemoto, Hirose","D.

This type of stimulation avoids accumulating charge on the electrodes so that adverse electrochemical reactions are eliminated or minimized. However, these devices are mostly limited to generating phase-locked, excitatory neural activity. In contrast, direct ionic current can excite, inhibit, and control neural sensitivity. For this reason, we developed a Freeform Stimulator (FS) neural implant. It uses a microfluidic system to convert charge-balanced current waveforms through the electrodes embedded in the device into ionic current waveforms at the output ports to provide arbitrary non-pulsatile waveforms for neuromodulation without harmful electrochemical reactions. Here, we describe and model the closed-loop control system used to operate the device.","neuromodulation, direct current stimulation, control systems",,,,,Academia,Grace,Foxworthy,"720 Rutland Ave","Ross 830","Biomedical Engineering","Johns Hopkins University",Baltimore,Maryland,21205,"United States",6177101105,,grace.foxworthy@jhu.edu,Grace,Foxworthy,"Johns Hopkins University",grace.foxworthy@jhu.edu,"United States",Gene,Fridman,"Johns Hopkins University",gfridma1@jhmi.edu,"United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Foxworthy, Fridman","G.

4165,"Design and Simulation of a Low Power 384-Channel Actively Multiplexed Neural Interface",Undecided,N/A,,,,,,,,,,7,"Electronics for Neuroscience","Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) provide clinical benefits including partial restoration of lost motor control, vision, speech, and hearing. A fundamental limitation of existing BCIs is their inability to span several areas (> cm2) of the cortex with fine (< 100 µm) resolution. One challenge of scaling neural interfaces is output wiring and connector sizes as each channel must be independently routed out of the brain. Time division multiplexing (TDM) overcomes this by enabling several channels to share the same output wire at the cost of added noise. This work leverages a 130-nm CMOS process and transfer printing to design and simulate a 384-channel actively multiplexed array, which minimizes noise by adding front end filtering and amplification to every electrode site (pixel). The pixels are 50 µm × 50 µm and enable recording of all 384 channels at 30 kHz with a gain of 22.3 dB, noise of 9.57 µV rms, bandwidth of 0.1 Hz – 10 kHz, while only consuming 0.63 µW/channel.

Due to the complex nature of the images and the heterogenous collection of parasites in the sample, classic pattern recognition and segmentation techniques such as Naïve Bayesian and watershed segmentation proved to be unsuitable for this application.

In addition, prosthetics applications require e-skins with human-level, sub-millimeter spatial resolution. This paper proposes to study two types of spike-based e-skin readout circuits, based on conventional and neuromorphic level crossing architectures. Compared to prior frame-based, coarse spatial resolution readout schemes, a sub-millimeter spiking e-skin scheme is modeled and compared to its frame-based counterpart in terms of power consumption and texture classification accuracy, using a Spiking Neural Network. Our analysis shows that the sparsity-inducing spike-based solutions achieve one order of magnitude lower power consumption while reaching a higher classification accuracy (87.92%) compared to the frame-based readout (74.58%).","electronic skin, spiking readout, level crossing",,,,,Academia,"Mark Daniel",Alea,,,ESAT,"KU Leuven",Leuven,,3000,Belgium,,,mark.alea@kuleuven.be,"Mark Daniel",Alea,"KU Leuven",mark.alea@kuleuven.be,Belgium,Ali,Safa,"KU Leuven",ali.safa@kuleuven.be,Belgium,Jonah,"Van Assche","KU Leuven",jonah.vanassche@kuleuven.be,Belgium,Georges,Gielen,"KU Leuven",georges.gielen@kuleuven.be,Belgium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alea, Safa, Van Assche, Gielen","M.

However, conventional TDM usually requires a sizeable central multiplexer or multiple row/column connections, which is cumbersome for space-constrained applications. We hereby present a distributed shift multiplexing (DSM) approach which is based on a shift- register controlled multiplexer distributed over discrete flip-flops and switches. In DSM, multi-sensor (M) arrays located at multiple positions (N nodes) are multiplexed using O(M) connections only. The suitability of DSM was tested using prototypes designed with integrated circuits available in catheter-integrable packages. The effective sampling rate (ESR) per node (out of 10) for DSM and compared to grid-based TDM ranged from 400 Hz (99%) to 20 kHz (60%) depending on the target multiplexing bandwidth and signal to error ratio. These results suggest that DSM is suitable for nearly-simultaneous acquisition from co- located multi-modal sensor arrays with sufficient bandwidth for a variety of bio-signals and applications.","Multi-modal catheter, distributed multiplexing, multi-modal bio-signal acquisition, smart catheter",,,,,Academia,Nishant,Gupta,,,,"Bern University of Applied Sciences",Biel,Bern,2502,Switzerland,,,nishant.gupta@bfh.ch,Nishant,Gupta,"Bern University of Applied Sciences",nishant.gupta@bfh.ch,Switzerland,Gerhard,Kuert,"Bern University of Applied Sciences",gerhardfrederic.kuert@bfh.ch,Switzerland,Adrian,Ryser,"University of Bern",adrian.ryser@insel.ch,Switzerland,Andreas,Haeberlin,"University of Bern",andreas.haeberlin@insel.ch,Switzerland,Thomas,Niederhauser,"Bern University of Applied Sciences",thomas.niederhauser@bfh.ch,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gupta, Kuert, Ryser, Haeberlin, Niederhauser","N.

In this work, we propose a novel fully HDC multi-level sensor fusion prosthetic control scheme. While prior work has only utilized HDC for recognition of static gestures held for 5 seconds, prosthetic control depends on task recognition with continuously changing EMG signals. To achieve this, we collect a multi-sensor dataset for 6 activities of daily living with feedback sensors, detailed sub-tasks and two levels of timing complexity. Finally, we demonstrate task recognition accuracy of 91% on the continuously changing EMG data, contributing a basis on which higher levels of control can be designed.","Prosthetic, EMG, Myoelectric, Brain-inspired, Task recognition, Multi-level control",,,,,Academia,Alisha,Menon,,,EECS,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,,94709,"United States",,,allymenon@berkeley.edu,Alisha,Menon,"University of California, Berkeley",allymenon@berkeley.edu,"United States",Laura,"I.

Additionally, the system can be used for the detection of the rate of periodic physiological motions such as diaphragm motion during breathing. The proposed localization system uses ISM bands and transmits a locked sub-harmonic 13.56 MHz signal generated from the received 40.68 MHz radio frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for a power-hungry oscillator. The localizer has a small form factor of 17 mm × 12 mm × 0.2 mm and consumes an average power of 6 μW.

This feature is owing to the ingenious configuration based on spoof plasmonic meta-waveguide and material characteristics. The PT-symmetric SPMW can be sensitively transferred from the unbroken phase to the broken phase by only varying a few percent (<3%) of ε\' value of polymer-based wave-transparent material, which leads to an asymmetric transmission of the plasma wave. More importantly, compared with other devices, this sensor affords 2D visual temperature imaging, which provides the precise monitoring of large-area body temperature. The combination of 2D material, graphene, further provides impressive flexibility and robustness for the practical applications of the whole system.

As a result, pulse-echo based imaging systems require bulky and complex analog as well as digital hardware. Frequency modulated continuous wave ultrasound (FMCW) systems are an attractive alternative where low-voltage continuous wave signalling is used for imaging. This paradigm lowers peak power consumption and the received echos can be demodulated to baseband frequency range and therefore digitized at a significantly lower sampling rate. In this work, we design and develop a FMCW-based ultrasound imaging device with the complete transmit and receive signal chain. We have fully characterized the electrical as well as acoustic parameters in order to fully optimize ultrasound imaging performance. We demonstrate A-mode imaging with our FMCW ultrasound imaging system and believe that our design can be effectively utilized in several applications involving dynamic imaging of deep-seated tissue.","ultrasound imaging, FMCW, time delay spectrometry, transceiver",,,,,Academia,Biswarup,Mukherjee,"Block 3, Room 397","Indian Institute of Technology Delh","Centre for Biomedical Engineering","Indian Institute of Technology Delhi","New Delhi",Delhi,110016,India,07439298071,,bmukherjee@iitd.ac.in,"Desh Deepak",Lawania,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi",desh.deepak.lawania@ee.iitd.ac.in,India,Biswarup,Mukherjee,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi",bmukherjee@iitd.ac.in,India,Ankesh,Jain,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi",ankesh@ee.iitd.ac.in,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lawania, Mukherjee, Jain","D.

A capacitively-coupled chopper instrumentation amplifier (CCCIA) is used in the AFEA to suppress flicker noise. To avoid the stimulation artifact from saturating the AFEA, the artifact cancellation loop is employed and enables the AFEA fast recover to normal operation after stimulation. The input referred noise within the bandwidth is 0.839μVrms. The measured THD is 0.155% under no artifact and 4.5% with 150mV DC offset, ±1V common-mode artifact (CMA), and ±10mV differential-mode artifact (DMA) under 2 kHz and 2.01 kHz of temporally interfering stimulation (TIS).","analog front-end amplifier, temporally interfering stimulation, input referred noise, artifact cancellation circuit",,,,,Academia,"Chi Wei",Huang,,,,"National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University","Hsinchu city",,300,Taiwan,,,rex.chiwei@gmail.com,"Chi Wei",Huang,"National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University",rex.chiwei@gmail.com,Taiwan,"Jian Jun",Wang,"National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University",s104323038@mail1.ncnu.edu.tw,Taiwan,"Chung Chih",Hung,"National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University",cchung@mail.nctu.edu.tw,Taiwan,"Chung Yu Wu",Wu,"National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University",peterwu@nycu.edu.tw,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Huang, Wang, Hung, Wu","C.
